#Bootstrap Styling Lab -Yer a (Styling) Wizard, Harry!

###Learing Objectives
* Build and style a single Hogwarts 'welcome page'
* Reinforce knowledge of Bootstrap fundamentals by practicing Bootstrap skills learned earlier in the day



###Your Lab:
Using Bootstrap and/or SASS, style a single 'welcome page' for a new wizard student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The Headmaster is not *incredibly* particular about the design, and encourages you to have fun, but he does have a few requirements:

1. Dumbledore would like visitors to the page to be able to see "stripes" of content. Since it's a welcome page, the first should include some reference to Hogwarts (images of the school crest and castle are provided, or you may choose your own) and a welcome message of your choosing.

2. In the second major content region, Dumbledore would like to highlight some current students. 
	- There is a sprite with various images of three of Hogwarts' most notable students -- use any portion of the sprite that you'd like, or source your own images, but make sure we can "meet" at least three students. 
	- You can choose to keep this simple, with a "Meet Your Classmates" header and no special text, or include student names (Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger) and houses (all Gryffindor, unless you add other students). 
 	- If you're feeling particularly creative, locate some quotes from the students.
 	- If you're enjoying grid magic, style this section so that the three students display in a row on some display sizes and stacked on others.

3. In another content region, students need to be able to learn about the four Houses into which they might be Sorted. 
	- Dumbledore is a huge fan of  responsive design magic, so he would like all four house descriptions to appear in a row when the page is viewed on a laptop (or a "medium-sized device"), but stacked in a single column on a smartphone (or "extra-small device"). He has no preference for tablet or large display views.
	- There's a handy sprite with the four House crests; use it to 
pair each House description with its crest (using background positioning magic!).
	- Prewritten copy for those descriptions is here:
	
		**Gryffindor**
		
		Gryffindor values bravery, daring, nerve, and chivalry. Its emblematic animal is the lion and its colours are scarlet and gold. Minerva McGonagall is the most recent Head of Gryffindor. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, aka Nearly Headless Nick, is the house ghost. The founder of the house is Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor corresponds to the element of Fire. The common room is located in one of the highest towers at Hogwarts, the entrance is situated on the seventh floor in the east wing of the castle and is guarded by a portrait of The Fat Lady. She permits entrance if given the correct password which is changed numerous times throughout the school year.
		
		**Hufflepuff**
		
		Hufflepuff, founded by Helga Hufflepuff, values hard work, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. Its emblematic animal is the badger, and Yellow and Black are its colours. Pomona Sprout was the Head of Hufflepuff during 1991 - 1998, Sprout left the post of Head of Hufflepuff and Herbology Professor sometime before 2017 and her successor for the position of Head of Hufflepuff is currently unknown. The Fat Friar is its ghost. Hufflepuff corresponds to the element of earth. The Hufflepuff Dormitories and common room are located somewhere in the basement, near the castle's kitchens. It can be accessed by tapping the barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row in the rhythem of "Helga Hufflepuff" and is described as being a cosy and welcoming place with yellow hangings, fat armchairs, and underground tunnels that lead to the dormitories, which have perfectly round doors, similar to barrel tops.
		
		**Ravenclaw**
		
		Ravenclaw values intelligence, knowledge, and wit. Its emblematic animal is the eagle, and its colours are blue and bronze. The Ravenclaw Head of House in the 1990s was Filius Flitwick. The ghost of Ravenclaw is the Grey Lady, who was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, the house's founder. Ravenclaw corresponds to the element of air. The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories are located in a tower on the west side of the castle. Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to enter their dormitories. This riddle, however, can be answered by non-Ravenclaws.
		
		**Slytherin**
		
		Slytherin house values ambition, cunning and resourcefulness and was founded by Salazar Slytherin. Its emblematic animal is the serpent, and its colours are emerald green and silver. Professor Horace Slughorn was the Head of Slytherin during the 1997â€“1998 school year, replacing Severus Snape, who as well, replaced Slughorn when he retired for the first time several years ago. The Bloody Baron is the house ghost. Slytherin corresponds roughly to the element of water. The Slytherin Dormitories and common room are reached through a bare stone wall in the Dungeons. The Slytherin common room lies beneath the Black Lake. It is a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and silver lamps hanging from the ceiling.
		
4. Style the rest of the page to your heart's content! Dumbledore is a particular fan of Glyphicons and Modals when they are used tastefully.

5.  **Bonus Wizard Challenge:** Add a fixed-position navbar to the top of the page, and use the Scrollspy spell to connect the links (and active state link) to anchors on the page that correspond with the sections you're making.
